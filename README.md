# U Gotta Do It - Task Manager

## Objetive:
The objective behind implementing this application is to improve my abilities as a web developer. Basically, to gain experience with Angular JS and Ruby on Rails.

## What can this task manager do:
Using this application, the user can add a task to a list of open tasks. After finishing a task, the user can mark the task as done and remove it from the system.

# Running the project locally:
Within the project folder, run the following commands:
```
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run "bundle install" to install the dependencies in the Gemfile.
3. Run "bower install" to install the dependencies in bower.json.
4. Run "rake db:migrate".
5. Run "bin/rails server" to start the application.
```
